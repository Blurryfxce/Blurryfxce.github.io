## JavaScript to TypeScript migration sample

### *About code* 
Should be multi-user chat simulator that implements back-end logic at the client level written by someone in **JavaScript**. The *program* simulates the operation of a server process to manage user connections, exchange messages, and maintain chat history.<br>

Final version of target file `index.js` contains rewrited code with added types (number, boolean, string) that, in theory, turns it into **TypeScript** syntax.
